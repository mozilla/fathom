// TODO: Integrate jkerim's static-scored, short-circuiting rules into the design. We can make rankers more introspectable. Rankers become hashes. If you return a static score for all matches, just stick an int in there like {score: 5}. Then the ruleset can be smart enough to run the rules emitting a given type in order of decreasing possible score. (Dynamically scored rules will always be run.) Of course, we'll also have to declare what types a rule can emit: {emits: ['titley']}. Move to a more declarative ranker also moves us closer to a machine-learning-based rule deriver (or at least tuner).


// Future possible fanciness:
// * Metarules, e.g. specific rules for YouTube if it's extremely weird. Maybe they can just take simple predicates over the DOM: metarule(dom => !isEmpty(dom.querySelectorAll('body[youtube]')), rule(...)). Maybe they'll have to be worse: the result of a full rank-and-yank process themselves. Or maybe we can somehow implement them without having to have a special "meta" kind of rule at all.
// * Different kinds of "mixing" than just multiplication, though this makes us care even more that rules execute in order and in series. An alternative may be to have rankers lay down the component numbers and a yanker do the fancier math.
// * Fancy combinators for rule sources, along with something like a Rete tree for more efficiently dispatching them. For example, rule(and(flavor('foo'), flavor('bar')), ...) would match only a node having both the foo and bar flavors.
// * If a ranker returns 0 (i.e. this thing has no chance of being in the category that I'm thinking about), delete the fact from the KB: a performance optimization.
// * I'm not sure about constraining us to execute the rules in order. It hurts efficiency and is going to lead us into a monkeypatching nightmare as third parties contribute rules. What if we instead used subflavors to order where necessary, where a subflavor is "(explicit-flavor, rule that touched me, rule that touched me next, ...)". A second approach: Ordinarily, if we were trying to order rules, we'd have them operate on different flavors, each rule spitting out a fact of a new flavor and the next rule taking it as input. Inserting a third-party rule into a ruleset like that would require rewriting the whole thing to interpose a new flavor. But what if we instead did something like declaring dependencies on certain rules but without mentioning them (in case the set of rules in the ruleset changes later). This draws a clear line between the ruleset's private implementation and its public, hookable API. Think: why would 3rd-party rule B want to fire between A and C? Because it requires some data A lays down and wants to muck with it before C uses it as input. That data would be part of facts of a certain flavor (if the ruleset designer is competent), and rules that want to hook in could specify where in terms of "I want to fire right after facts of flavor FOO are made." They can then mess with the fact before C sees it.
// * We could even defer actually multiplying the ranks together, preserving the individual factors, in case we can get any interesting results out of comparing the results with and without certain rules' effects.
// * Probably fact flavors and the score axes should be separate: fact flavors state what flavor of notes are available about nodes (and might affect rule order if they want to use each other's notes). Score axes talk about the degree to which a node is in a category. Each fact would be linked to a proxy for a DOM node, and all scores would live on those proxies.
// * It probably could use a declarative yanking system to go with the ranking one: the "reduce" to its "map". We may want to implement a few imperatively first, though, and see what patterns shake out.

// Yankers:
// max score (of some flavor)
// max-scored sibling cluster (maybe a contiguous span of containers around high-scoring ones, like a blur algo allowing occasional flecks of low-scoring noise)
// adjacent max-scored sibling clusters (like for Readability's remove-extra-paragraphs test, which has 2 divs, each containing <p>s)
//
// Yanking:
// * Block-level containers at the smallest. (Any smaller, and you're pulling out parts of paragraphs, not entire paragraphs.) mergedInnerTextNakedOrInInInlineTags might make this superfluous.
//
//
// Advantages over readability:
// * State clearly contained
// * Should work fine with ideographic languages and others that lack space-delimited words
// * Pluggable
// * Potential to have rules generated or tuned by training
// * Adaptable to find things other than the main body text
// * Potential to perform better since it doesn't have to run over and over, loosening constraints each time, if it fails
